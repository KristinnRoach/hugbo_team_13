This project is a group assignment in a course on Software Development at Háskóli Íslands. 

The purpose of the assignment was to gain project management and collaboration experience leaning on RUP methadology, 
while utilizing Java Spring to implement an MVC structured web application.

We created a gaming events website where users can:
sign up, create events, search for events to attend, add games to the sites repository, manage their profiles and add friends.
